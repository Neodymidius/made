Sunshine or Storms: Exploring the Weather's Influence on Stock Market Trends

## Main Question

<!-- Think about one main question you want to answer based on the data. -->
1. To what degree is the weather a factor to the stock market and does an increase of extreme weather show any influence to the stock market?

## Description

<!-- Describe your data science project in max. 200 words. Consider writing about why and how you attempt it. -->
The main drive for change in an economic system in democratic countries is the free market and its 
stock market behaviour. It is therefore favourable for companies to prevent loss due to extreme weather phenomenas if
there exist any loss. By showing any affection between long term stock data of various markets and the weather
data like temperature and rain we could infer that climate change plays a role in the market and therefore
could induce a faster change to a sustainable economy.
