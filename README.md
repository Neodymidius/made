# MADE: Data Engeering

This project is part of the MADE module of the FAU.

## Extraction of weather data and energy production of Germany
The hourly temperature and the hourly recorded energy production of Germany will be extracted and compared. This project uses a mix of Python and Jayvee. Python is used for getting the data and also doing some reformating while Jayvee is the foundation for saving the newly shaped data into a database. In this case, sqlite3 was used.
